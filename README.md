# Dotfiles

See [How To Easily Manage Your Dotfiles With GNU Stow](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow).

Main directories:

* `nvim` - my [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) config
* `wezterm` - my [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/) config 
* `yazi` - my [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) config

Pretty much everything else is old guff prior to discovering GNU Stow.
